        <p>Detective fiction is a subgenre of crime fiction and mystery fiction in which an investigator or 
        a detective—either professional, amateur or retired—investigates a crime, often murder. The detective 
        genre began around the same time as speculative fiction and other genre fiction in the mid-nineteenth 
        century and has remained extremely popular, particularly in novels.[1] Some of the most famous heroes 
        of detective fiction include C. Auguste Dupin, Sherlock Holmes, and Hercule Poirot. Juvenile stories 
        featuring The Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and The Boxcar Children have also remained in print for several decades.</p>
